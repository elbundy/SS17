\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Probability of zombieapocalype of $0.00666$ seems justified
    \item
        If there is a zombieapocalyse, the probabiltity of no beer at berg is probably 1 (except bavarian zombies still have bear breawing skills)
    \item
        The probability that there is no beer at berg when the TechFak gets an Nobel price could be smaller then without it
    \item
        If there is a zombieapocalypse, there probably wont be a new university in Nuremberg (except there exist scholar zombies)
    \item
        When the TechFak gets an Nobel price, there probably wont be a new univercity in Nuremberg, else maybe (20\%)
    \item
        If there is no beer at berg, the TechFak will move to Nuremberg with a probability of 1 (seems justified)
    \item
        A Nobel price will make it less probable that the Techfak moves to Nuremberg
\end{itemize}

$P(zombieapocalypse | NoBeerAtBerg) = 0.87123$ (Holy shit, we're dooomed!!!)

\section*{Problem 3.2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        action $a$: I am going to play with $x$ amount of money
    \item
        evidence $e$: Hey, I am able to play
    \item
        $s' = (n, x)$
    \item
        $U(s') = (2^n - x)$
    \item
        $P(R(a) = (n,x) | a,e) = 2^{-n}$
    \item
        $EU(a|e) = \sum_{s'} P(R(a) = s' | a,e) \cdot U(s')$
    \item
        $EU(a = x|e) = \sum_{n} 2^{-n} \cdot (2^n - x) = \sum_{n}1 - x 2^{-n} = 0$
    \item
        Solve for x... But how?
\end{itemize}
